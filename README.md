# OOP-Fractions
This is my introduction to Object-Orientated programming and the first piece of code I developed to learn OOP

This program was aimed to awnser 4 tasks.

1. Create a class Fraction using objects to represents the Numerator and Denominator. 
-Have the ability to store each element, 
-Return individually the values of each stored element
-Modify any stored fraction by modifing a chosen element of the fraction
-to return a fraction object in its lowest terms   e.g. 18/4 --> 9/2

2. Create a function that will return a stored fraction in the forms:
-Initial --> 18/4
-Mixed --> 4 1/2
-Real --> 4.5


3. Using the main, read in the text file and print all of them using the function in Q2
